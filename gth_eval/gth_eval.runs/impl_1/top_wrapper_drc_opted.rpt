AVAL-326#1 Critical Warning
Hard_block_must_have_LOC  
The hard block GTHE4_CHANNEL cell test_tx_INST/gth_INST/inst/gen_gtwizard_gthe4_top.gth_module_gtwizard_gthe4_inst/gen_gtwizard_gthe4.gen_channel_container[0].gen_enabled_channel.gthe4_channel_wrapper_inst/channel_inst/gthe4_channel_gen.gen_gthe4_channel_inst[0].GTHE4_CHANNEL_PRIM_INST is missing a valid LOC constraint for placement assignment, normally supplied by IP generation or manually assigned using the LOC property. Unguided placement of this block may cause problems in routing or other issues. Please check your design and set a valid LOC for this block to avoid these problems.
Related violations: <none>

AVAL-326#2 Critical Warning
Hard_block_must_have_LOC  
The hard block IBUFDS_GTE4 cell rx_INST/IBUFDS_GTE4_MGTREFCLK0_X0Y0_INST is missing a valid LOC constraint for placement assignment, normally supplied by IP generation or manually assigned using the LOC property. Unguided placement of this block may cause problems in routing or other issues. Please check your design and set a valid LOC for this block to avoid these problems.
Related violations: <none>

AVAL-326#3 Critical Warning
Hard_block_must_have_LOC  
The hard block IBUFDS_GTE4 cell test_tx_INST/IBUFDS_GTE4_MGTREFCLK0_X0Y0_INST is missing a valid LOC constraint for placement assignment, normally supplied by IP generation or manually assigned using the LOC property. Unguided placement of this block may cause problems in routing or other issues. Please check your design and set a valid LOC for this block to avoid these problems.
Related violations: <none>

NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
2 out of 6 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: freerun_clk, reset.
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
6 out of 6 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: freerun_clk, ref_clk_rx_n, ref_clk_rx_p, ref_clk_tx_n, ref_clk_tx_p, reset.
Related violations: <none>
